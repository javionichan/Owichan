🛡️ Owichan - Wi-Fi Security Auditing Tool 📡
📝 Description
Owichan is a Python-based project designed to audit Wi-Fi networks and detect common security vulnerabilities, such as:

-🔓 Open networks

-🔐 WEP encryption

-📶 WPS enabled

-⚠️ And more...

This script uses tools like Scapy, Aircrack-ng, and Wireshark/Tshark to analyze wireless networks and generate detailed reports.

⚠️ Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and authorized audits only. Improper use may violate local laws.

🚨 Detected Vulnerabilities
The script detects the following vulnerabilities:

-🔓 Open Wi-Fi networks (no encryption)

-🔐 WEP encryption (obsolete and insecure)

-📶 WPS enabled (vulnerable to brute-force attacks)

-🧩 Other vulnerabilities (like weak passwords or insecure authentication) can be implemented through additional modules.

🧰 Technologies Used
-🐍 Python / Scapy: Packet capture and analysis

-🛠️ Aircrack-ng: Penetration testing (e.g., WPS)

-🔍 Wireshark / Tshark: Traffic analysis (optional)

-💻 Bash: System commands

📦 Requirements
🐧 Linux-based OS (Recommended: Kali Linux or Ubuntu)

📡 Wi-Fi adapter with monitor mode support (e.g., Atheros or Ralink chipset)

🔧 Dependencies:
sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng wireshark tshark python3-scapy
pip install scapy

🔐 Root permissions to run the script

⚙️ Installation
Clone or download the repository:
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd owichan
Make sure all dependencies are installed (see Requirements)

Give execution permissions to the script:
chmod +x wifi_audit.py

▶️ Usage
Run the script with root permissions:
sudo python3 wifi_audit.py
📥 Enter your Wi-Fi interface name (e.g., wlan0)
⏱️ The script will scan for networks for 30 seconds
📄 It will generate a console report and a log file (wifi_audit.log)
